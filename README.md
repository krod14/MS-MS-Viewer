The purpose of this code is to display peptide fragmentation spectra from an mzXML file. 
This program takes an mzXML file, a scan number, and a peptide sequence as input.
The peptide's b-ion and y-ion m/z values are computed, and peaks matching these m/z values are annotated
The output plot helps the user determine if the peptide seqeunce is a good match to the spectrum.
